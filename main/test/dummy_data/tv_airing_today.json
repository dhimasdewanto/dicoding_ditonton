The Mole's goal is to make the assignments fail and keep the amount of money earned as low as possible. The other candidates do not know who the Mole is and need to unmask them. At the end of every episode, the candidates take a multiple-choice test about the mole's identity. The person who gives the least amount of correct answers is \"executed\" and must leave. This process continues until only two contestants and the Mole remain. The winner is the person with the most correct answers in the final test and they get all of the money earned in previous stages of the game.",
